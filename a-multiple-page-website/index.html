    <p><a href="http://www.mikesinkula.com/" target="_blank">Mike Sinkula</a> grew up in Southern California  went on to earn a BA in Visual  Communication/Graphic Design, from <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/" target="_blank">California State  University at Chico</a> in 1993.</p>
    <p>Early in 1994 Mike came to Seattle to work in its booming graphic   design industry. He went on to work for a few years in the corporate   sector of Seattle for such companies as <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">Nintendo of America</a> and Sierra On-line designing and  producing artwork for “Nintendo Power” and “Interaction” Magazine.</p>
    <p><img id="picture" src="images/img-myface.jpg" alt="Mike Sinkula is a Clown" height="175" width="150" />In 1997 Mike founded <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/">Premium Design Works</a> to get  away from the corporate industry and to find a path that suited his  ideology. This allowed Mike to create <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/logos/">logos</a> for small  business, design and produce <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/advertisments/">advertising</a> work for non-profit organizations and create <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/collateral/">collateral</a> for musicians and recording companies.</p>
    <p>To compete in the new information-age industry, Mike found himself   learning web design and development along the way as he designed <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/websites/">websites</a> for  local software and net-casting companies in the late 1990s. In  order to  learn even more about the web design industry, Mike put <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/">Premium  Design Works</a> on hold in the year 2000 to take a position as a User  Interface designer with <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/" target="_blank">Drugstore.com</a>.</p>
    <p>By late 2001 Mike was offered a web design instructor position at <a href="http://seattlecentral.edu/" target="_blank">Seattle Central Community College</a>.  He has found that  teaching college level design and development  courses has been a  fulfilling asset to his life and that it has enabled  him to keep his  finger on the pulse of the web design and development industry.</p>
