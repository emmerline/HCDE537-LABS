    <p>Office of Graduate Admissions<strong><br />
    University of Washington</strong><br />
    301 Loew Hall, MS 352191<br />
    Seattle, WA 98195-2191</p>
    <p>To whom it may concern:</p>
    <p>In 1994, I came the greater Seattle area to find a job in the booming graphic    design industry shortly after I had earned a Bachelor of Arts in Visual Communication from <a href="http://www.csuchico.edu/" target="_blank">California State University at Chico</a> in 1993. The industry that I found here in Seattle at that time was ripe for a fresh new face with a design degree and digital pre-press experience. I was fortunate enough to work for a few years in the corporate sector of Seattle for such companies as <a href="http://www.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">Nintendo of America</a> and Sierra On-line designing and  producing artwork for “Nintendo Power” and “Interaction” Magazine.</p>
    <p>By 1997 I founded <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/">Premium Design Works</a> to get  away from the corporate industry and to find a path that suited my <a title="http://www.premiumdw.com/about-2/ideology/" href="http://www.premiumdw.com/about-2/ideology/" target="_blank"> ideology</a> a little better. Starting my own graphic design business allowed me to create <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/logos/">logos</a> for small business, design and produce <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/advertisments/">advertising</a> work for non-profit organizations and create <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/collateral/">collateral</a> for musicians and recording companies. To compete in the new information-age industry, I also found myself learning web design and development along the way as I designed <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/portfolio/websites/">websites</a> for  local software and net-casting companies in the late 1990s.</p>
    <p>In order to learn even more about the web design industry, I put <a href="http://www.premiumdw.com/">Premium  Design Works</a> on hold in the year 2000 to take a position as a User  Interface designer with <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/" target="_blank">Drugstore.com</a>. By late 2001 I was then offered a web design instructor position at Seattle Central Community College (SCCC) and was able to pick up my graphic design business once again while focusing on web design and development.</p>
    <p>Teaching college level design and development courses while working as an industry professional has been a fulfilling asset to my life and has enabled me to keep my  finger on the pulse of the web design and development industry. Our program at SCCC has <a title="http://www.mikesinkula.com/2009/10/the-new-workspace/" href="http://www.mikesinkula.com/2009/10/the-new-workspace/" target="_blank">grown quite rapidly in the last few years</a> and has been an incredible journey to say the least.</p>
    <p>As the years have rolled on, I have embraced that teaching at SCCC is what I was meant to do with my life at this time. Although only a part-time instructor, I have been central to the success of our web design and development program. I have not only been one of the core instructors for the program, but have designed and development much of its curriculum while also training and mentoring new instructors.</p>
    <p>The classes that I have written and have been teaching most recently include:</p>

    </ol>
    <p>Now, I am interested in pursuing the open full-time position with the college, but lack the Master&#8217;s degree required. Therefore, I am interested in the <a title="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/" href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/" target="_blank">Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering (HCDE)</a> graduate program to further my  career with SCCC.</p>
    <p>I originally heard about the HCDE program at the University of Washington from a former student of mine, <a title="http://www.appliedanthrodesign.com/" href="http://www.appliedanthrodesign.com/" target="_blank">Kristina Krause</a>, who needed a letter of recommendation to be accepted to the program. The name of the program certainly piqued my interest and I started to look into the program for myself. I also talked with a few of my friends and former students that had enrolled in the <a title="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/nav-prog-advise/certificates/cert-ucd" href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/nav-prog-advise/certificates/cert-ucd" target="_blank">HCDE User-Centered Design (UCD) Certificate Program</a>. What I found was impressive and had a good reputation. In the last year I have been able to take two courses as graduate non-matriculated status in the HCDE program and have enjoyed myself.</p>
    <p>My intention is to now officially enroll in the <a title="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/nav-prog-advise/pmp" href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/nav-prog-advise/pmp" target="_blank">HCDE Professional Master&#8217;s Program</a> and complete the <a title="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/nav-prog-advise/pmp/curriculum/ucd" href="http://www.hcde.washington.edu/nav-prog-advise/pmp/curriculum/ucd" target="_blank">User-Centered Design (UCD) pathway</a>. By completing this Master&#8217;s degree program in HCDE at the University of Washington, I will be qualified to get the full-time web design and development instructor position at SCCC.</p>
    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
